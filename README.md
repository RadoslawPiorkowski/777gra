# General info
A game that allows you to enter a virtual casino and play a 777 slots game. There are three characters representing difficulty levels, a locally saved scoreboard, eye-catching, hand-made graphics and background music. There is a hidden cheat mode in the single player mode - you must press the 5 symbols in the correct order to activate it (if you know about it, it's easy to guess which ones). There is also a two-player mode in the game.

The current version of the game is in Polish.
